	<!-- <h2 style='color:#000'>Welcome to the QUICK.NG Privacy Policy</h2><br/> -->
<h3>Our Policy</h3>
<p>Last modified: December 12, 2015</p><br/>
<p>When you use <b><a href="http://www.quick.ng">Quick.ng</a></b>, you trust us with your personal and non-personal 
information. Your privacy is an important factor that QUICK.NG (that's us) considers in the development of each and every of our products and services. We are committed to being transparent and open. This <b><a href="http://quick.ng/help.php?q=privacy">Privacy Policy</a></b> explains generally what data (information) we collect about you, how we receive it, and what we do with it once we have it.</p>

<p>For us, <b>Personal information</b> means information which identifies you, like your <b>name</b> or <b>email address</b>, <b>postal address</b>, <b>phone number</b>. Any information that falls outside of these is a <b>non-personal</b> information.</p><br/>

<h4>Getting Your Information</h4>
<p><b>We learn information about you when:</b></p>
<p>1.	You give it to us directly (e.g., when you create an account with us).</p>
<p>2.	We collect it automatically through your continual use of our products and services.</p>
<p>3.	Someone else tells us information about you.</p>
<p>4.	We use demographic and geographic tools in accessing IP addresses, Location, Gender, etc, for the purpose of serving you better.</p>
<p>When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.</p><br/>

<h4>Sharing Your Information</h4>
<p><b>The reasons we share your information with others are:</b></p>
<p>1.	We have asked and received your permission to share it. (E.g. where you seek a roommate on our Roomie Zone or any other platform of ours).</p>
<p>2.	For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by QUICK.NG.</p>
<p>3.	When the law requires it. We follow the law, therefore whenever we receive requests about you from the government or related to a lawsuit, we won't hesitate to. We'll however notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way, unless we're legally prohibited from doing so.</p>
<p>When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have in good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.</p>
<p>4.	When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We will only share your information in this way if we have in good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect your rights, property or safety; that of other users, QUICK.NG, or the public.</p>
<p>5.	If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, or we are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.</p><br/>

<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures in making sure we protect your data. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>
<p>We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.</p>
<p>Your information is stored on our servers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, note that although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p><br/>

<p><b>General</b></p>	
<p>We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through QUICK.NG’s usual channels.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.</p>
